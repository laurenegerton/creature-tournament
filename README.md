# creature-tournament

This program uses inheritance and polymorphism by using an abstract base class (Creature) and derived classes (Medusa, Barbarian, Vampire, BlueMen, HarryPotter) that use virtual functions to override the base class functions (attack and defense). It also uses Stack-like and Queue-like linked lists to hold and display creatures.
